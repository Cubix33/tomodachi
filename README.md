The AI-Driven Patient Appointment & Hospital Resource Optimization System is an advanced healthcare management solution that schedules doctor consultations based on the predicted severity of a patient's condition. Using machine learning models, it prioritizes high-severity patients for earlier appointments while ensuring alignment with doctor availability and shift timings. The system prevents scheduling conflicts, manages doctor breaks, and enforces a 48-hour appointment confirmation rule, allowing only walk-in and emergency bookings afterward. Additionally, an admin panel provides real-time insights into hospital resources, including beds, equipment, and staff, and leverages LSTM and ARIMA models to predict the next dayâ€™s resource requirements. At the end of each day, hospital staff update actual resource usage, refining future predictions. This AI-powered system enhances patient care, optimizes hospital workflows, and improves resource planning, leading to efficient hospital operations and better healthcare outcomes.
